This program is written to generate mock data for FFB, who has one giant fact table that contains snapshotted daily account balances.

To mock up data across x accounts and n days, I divided the program into two parts. First is to create a base table, which contains x accounts info for 1 day. Then I modify the base table minorly and replicate across n-1 days.

The parameters used to generate the mock data is thru a parameter file. The parm file is imported as a python library for main.py to reference. This is probably not the best coding practice but it was the easy.

To run the program, simply modify the paramter file to your liking and run "python main.py"

The files will be generated and stored in the specified folder.
